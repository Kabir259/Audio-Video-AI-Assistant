# Audio-Video-AI-Assistant

You need an `openai-api-key` to run this code _(and a credit card too hehe)_.


If you are running the code on Apple M1/2/3, run the following command in the terminal:

```
$ brew install portaudio
```

Create a conda environment, update pip, and install the required packages:

```
$ conda create -n "YOURENV" python=3.9
$ conda activate "YOURENV"
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the assistant:

```
$ python assistant.py
```
